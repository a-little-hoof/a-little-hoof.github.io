> Apart from publishing academic papers, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and practical insights with the wider community. I believe that research can have a broader impact when complemented by open-source projects and technical blogs. That's why I keep things I want to share with other people here.

## Code
- [Implementation of Glow](). My implementation of the Glow model.

## Blog
- [How to learn diffusion models](https://www.zhihu.com/question/658056360/answer/3526228476). Paper list I created for learning diffusion models and the follow up ODE based generative models.

## Other people's work I found inspiring
- [A introduction to flow matching](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/blog/2024/01/20/flow-matching.html). High level ideas on flow matching and stochastic interpolants, blog by Tor Fjelde, Emile Mathieu, Vincent Dutordoir.
