## Research statement
My research is driven by the goal of building generative models that can truely understand the physical world. To achieve the goal, I seek statistical machine learning methods to model the underlying data distribution. My experience thus far has focused on deep generative models, such as diffusion models and normalizing flows, in solving inverse problems.

Looking ahead, I am excited to explore cutting-edge developments in generative models such as flow matching, rectified flows, and stochastic interpolants. I am eager to contribute to their theoretical and practical advancements.
