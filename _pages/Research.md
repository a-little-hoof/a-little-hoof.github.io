## Research statement
My research is driven by the goal of building generative AI models that can truely understand the physical world. To achieve the goal, I seek statistical machine learning methods to model the underlying data distribution. My experience thus far has focused on advanced generative modeling methods, particularly diffusion models and normalizing flows, which I have applied to various tasks, including solving inverse problems and model alignment.

Through these applications, I have gained valuable insights into how generative models can be tailored to practical challenges. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of the intersection between theory and application, and demonstrated the potential of generative models in scientific imaging and large text-to-image model alignment.

Looking ahead, I am excited to explore cutting-edge developments in generative models such as flow matching, rectified flows, and stochastic interpolants. I am eager to contribute to their theoretical and practical advancements. My long-term goal is to push the boundaries of how AI can model complex systems, bridging the gap between data-driven approaches and the understanding of the physical world.
