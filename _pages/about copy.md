- I am a first year PhD student at Rice University, where I am advised by [Prof. Chen Wei](https://weichen582.github.io/) and [Dr. Weijian Luo](https://pkulwj1994.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.S. from Peking University, advised by [Prof. He Sun](https://ai4imaging.github.io/). My research focuses on generative modeling. 
  
- Besides research, I enjoy hiking and running. I've participated in several marathons, and I once spent an entire summer involved in ecological field research in Saihanba and Xihaigu.

- I actively write blogs on [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/cameron-78-28).

<!-- - I'm applying for PhD positions starting in Fall 2025. Here is my [CV](https://a-little-hoof.github.io/files/Resume_Yifei Wang_PKU 2025.pdf). -->
