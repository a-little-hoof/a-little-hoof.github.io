- My name is Yifei Wang, which is 王翼飞 in Chinese. I am currently a sophomore in Peking University, and is also a member of [the Tong Class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/).
  
- My research interests lie in computer vision and generative models.
  
- Besides my academic life, I am a huge fun of long-distance running. I like to run with my friends in the [BOYA Middle and Long Distance Track Team](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Kg2df2wnqnYab3R-K5GjAA) and share my feelings about running. You can see more in the blog page.
