- I am a senior undergraduate at Peking University, where I am advised by [Prof. He Sun](https://ai4imaging.github.io/). I am also also affiliated with [Tong class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/), Yuanpei College. My research focuses on generative models, low level vision and AI for science. 
  
- Besides research, I enjoy hiking and running. I've participated in several marathons, and I once spent an entire summer involved in ecological field research in Saihanba and Xihaigu.

- I actively write blogs on [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/cameron-78-28).

- I'm applying for PhD positions starting in Fall 2025.[ Here is my CV.](https://a-little-hoof.github.io/files/Resume_Yifei Wang_PKU 2025.pdf)
