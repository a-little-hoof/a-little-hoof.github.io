- My name is Yifei Wang. I am currently a senior in Peking University.
  
- My research interests lie in low level vision and generative models.
  
<!-- - Besides my academic life, I am a huge fan of long-distance running. I like to run with my friends in the [BOYA Middle and Long Distance Track Team](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Kg2df2wnqnYab3R-K5GjAA) and share my feelings about running. You can see more in the blog page. -->
