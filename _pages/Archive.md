> Apart from publishing academic papers, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and practical insights with the wider community. I believe that research can have a broader impact when complemented by open-source projects and technical blogs. That's why I keep things I want to share with other people here.

## Code
- [Implementation of Glow](). My implementation of the Glow model.
- [EDM](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm). State-of-the-art diffusion model implementation.
- [Deep learning notebooks](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/). A comprehensive guide that provides clear instructions for implementing various deep learning models.

## Technical Blog
- [A introduction to flow matching](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/blog/2024/01/20/flow-matching.html). High level ideas on flow matching and stochastic interpolants.
- [Step-by-Step Diffusion: An Elementary Tutorial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08929). A beginner's guide to diffusion models, where the authors start from an ODE perspective and exclude all stochastic elements of diffusion models.
- [Deep learning tuning playbook](https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook). Tricks for doing deep learning projects.
- [Learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=zh_CN). This website helps you learn git by visualize your git commands.

## Misc.
- [How to learn diffusion models](https://www.zhihu.com/question/658056360/answer/3526228476). A list of papers I created for learning diffusion models and the follow-up ODE-based generative models.
- [10 easy ways to fail a Ph.D.](https://matt.might.net/articles/ways-to-fail-a-phd/).
- [Writing personal statement for graduate school application](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/write_statement.html)
