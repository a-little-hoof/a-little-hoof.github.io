> Apart from publishing academic papers, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and practical insights with the wider community. I believe that research can have a broader impact when complemented by open-source projects and technical blogs.

## Code
- [Implementation of Glow](https://github.com/a-little-hoof/Glow). My implementation of the Glow model in pytorch.
- [EDM](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm). State-of-the-art diffusion model implementation.
- [Deep learning notebooks](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/). A comprehensive guide that provides clear instructions for implementing various deep learning models.
- [Build GPT2](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt/commits/master/?after=6104ab1b53920f6e2159749676073ff7d815c1fa+34) Karpathy's step by step implementation of the GPT2 model. A good way to learn how to build a project from scratch.

## Technical Blog
- [A introduction to flow matching](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/blog/2024/01/20/flow-matching.html). High level ideas on flow matching and stochastic interpolants.
- [Step-by-Step Diffusion: An Elementary Tutorial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08929). A beginner's guide to diffusion models, where the authors start from an ODE perspective and exclude all stochastic elements of diffusion models.
- [Deep learning tuning playbook](https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook). Tricks for doing deep learning projects.
- [Learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=zh_CN). This website helps you learn git by visualize your git commands.
- [Trouble shooting for installing cuda toolkit on a server that you do not have a sudo access.](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/5388213969)

## Misc.
- [How to learn diffusion models](https://www.zhihu.com/question/658056360/answer/3526228476). A list of papers I created for learning diffusion models and the follow-up ODE-based generative models.
